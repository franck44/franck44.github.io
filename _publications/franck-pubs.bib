  abstract = {We address the problem of computing the worst-case execu- tion-time (WCET) of binary programs using a real-time model-checker. 
  In our previous work, we introduced a fully automated and modular methodology to build a model (network of timed automata) that combined a binary 
  program and the hardware to run the program on. 
  Computing the WCET amounts to finding the longest path time-wise in this model, which can be done using a real-time model checker like Uppaal. 
  In this work, we generalise the previous approach and we define a generic framework to support arbitrary binary language and hardware.
We have implemented our new approach in an extended version of Uppaal, called Wuppaal. 
Experimental results using some standard benchmarks suite for WCET computation (from Malardalen University) 
show that our technique is practical and promising.}

Scala has traditionally relied on combinator libraries for defining parsers but being libraries they come with fundamental implementation limitations. An alternative is to use a Java-based parser generator such as ANTLR or Rats! but these tools are quite verbose and not ideal to use with Scala code. We describe our experiences with Scala-focused parser generation that is embodied in our sbtrats plugin for the Scala Build Tool. At its simplest, sbtrats provides a bridge to the Rats! parser generator for Java. On top of this bridge, we have a simple grammar definition notation that incorporates annotations for tree construction and pretty-printing. As well as generating a Rats! grammar, sbtrats can optionally generate case class definitions for the tree structure and a pretty-printer defined using our Kiama language processing library. We explain the sbtrats grammar notation and describe our positive experiences using it to define grammars for LLVM assembly notation and the SMTLIB input/output language for SMT solvers.},

  abstract={Our reliance on cyber–physical systems (CPSs) is increasingly widespread, but scalable methods for the analysis of such systems remain a significant challenge. Runtime verification of CPSs provides a reasonable middle ground between formal verification and simulation approaches, but it comes with its own challenges. A runtime verification system must run directly on the deployed application. In the CPS domain, it is therefore critical that a runtime verification system exhibits low overhead and good scalability so that the verification does not interfere with the analyzed CPS application. In this paper, we introduce Brace, a runtime verification system whose focus is on ensuring these performance qualities for applications in the CPS domain. Brace strives to bound the computation overhead for CPS runtime verification while preserving a high level of monitoring accuracy in terms of the number of false positive and false negative reports. Brace is particularly suitable to systems in which scheduling is distributed across networked CPS components. We evaluate Brace to determine how effectively and efficiently it can detect injected errors in two existing real-life CPS applications with distributed scheduling. Our results demonstrate that Brace efficiently detects those errors and a few true bugs and is able to bound both the memory and computation overhead even in systems with large numbers of observed events.},

The systems model considered is one in which agents operate synchronously with awareness of the global clock. This enables timing based attacks to be captured, whereas previous work on this topic has dealt primarily with asynchronous systems. Versions of the notions of nondeducibility on inputs, nondeducibility on strategies, and an unwinding based notion are formulated for this model. All three notions are shown to be decidable, and their computational complexity is characterised.},

  abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have gained wide popularity, however, developing and debugging CPS remain significant challenges. Many bugs are detectable only at runtime under deployment conditions that may be unpredictable or at least unexpected at development time. The current state of the practice of debugging CPS is generally ad hoc, involving trial and error in a real deployment. For increased rigor, it is appealing to bring formal methods to CPS verification. However developers often eschew formal approaches due to complexity and lack of efficiency. This paper presents Brace Assertion, a specification framework based on natural language queries that are automatically converted to a determinitic class of timed automata used for runtime monitoring. To reduce runtime overhead and support properties that reference predicate logic, we use a second monitor automaton to create filtered traces on which to run the analysis using the specification monitor. We evaluate the Brace Assertion framework using a real CPS case study and show that the framework is able to minimize runtime overhead with an increasing number of monitors.},

On the one hand, the most successful approaches to address the control state explosion problem are based on assume-guarantee reasoning or model-checking coupled with partial order reduction. On the other hand, the most successful techniques to address the data space explosion problem for sequential programs verification are based on the abstraction/refine- ment paradigm which consists in refining an abstract over-approximation of a program via predicate refinement. In this paper, we show that we can combine partial order reduction techniques with trace abstraction refinement. We apply our approach to standard benchmarks and show that it matches current state-of-the-art analysis techniques.},

security property that the system must satisfy is a non-interference property.
Intuitively, non-interference ensures the absence of any causal dependency from
a high-level domain to a lower level domain. Various notions of non-interference
have been defined in the literature, and in this paper, we focus on strong non-
deterministic non-interference (SNNI) and two (bi)simulation-based variants
thereof (cosimulation-based SNNI and bisimulation-based SNNI). These properties
and their extensions have been mostly studied in the context of discrete event
systems, while it is now well-known that time is an important attack vector
against secure systems. At the same time, there is an obvious interest in going
beyond simple verification to control problems: to be able to automatically make
systems secure. We consider non-interference properties in the challenging
setting of control of dense-time systems specified by timed automata and we
study the two following problems: (1) check whether it is possible to find a
sub-system so that it is non- interferent; if yes, (2) compute a (largest) sub-
system which is non- interferent. We exhibit decidable sub-classes for these
problems, assess their theoretical complexities and provide effective algorithms
based on the classical framework of timed games.}

The systems model considered is one in which agents operate synchronously with awareness of the global clock. This enables timing based attacks to be captured, whereas previous work on this topic has dealt primarily with asynchronous systems. Versions of the notions of nondeducibility on inputs, nondeducibility on strategies, and an unwinding based notion are formulated for this model. All three notions are shown to be decidable, and their computational complexity is characterised.

We prove that bounded GTPNs, bounded TPNs and TA are equally expressive w.r.t. timed language acceptance.
Finally, we characterise a syntactical subclass of TA that is equally expressive to bounded GTPNs "á la Merlin" w.r.t.
weak timed bisimilarity. These results provide a unified comparison of the expressiveness of
many variants of timed models often used in practice. It leads to new important results for TPNs.
Among them are: 1-safe TPNs and bounded-TPNs are equally expressive; $\epsilon$-transitions strictly
increase the expressive power of TPNs; self modifying nets as well as read,
inhibitor and reset arcs do not add expressiveness to bounded TPNs.

  In this paper we study the fault codiagnosis problem for discrete event systems given by finite automata (FA) and timed systems given by timed automata (TA). We provide a uniform characterisation of codiagnosability for FA and TA which extends the necessary and sufficient condition that characterises diagosability. We also settle the complexity of the codiagnosability problems both for FA and TA and show that codiagnosability is PSPACE-complete in both cases. For FA this improves on the previously known bound (EXPTIME) and for TA it is a new result. We then generalise the previous results to the case of dynamic observers. Finally we show that the codiagnosis problem for TA under bounded resources is 2EXPTIME-complete.

Opacity is a security property formalizing the absence of secret information leakage and we address in this paper the problem of synthesizing opaque systems. A secret predicate S over the runs of a system G is opaque to an external user having partial observ- ability over G, if s/he can never infer from the observation of a run of G that the run belongs to S. We choose to control the observability of events by adding a device, called a mask, between the system G and the users. We first investigate the case of static partial observability where the set of events the user can observe is fixed a priori by a static mask. In this context, we show that checking whether a system is opaque is PSPACE-complete, which implies that computing an optimal static mask ensuring opacity is also a PSPACE-complete problem. Next, we introduce dynamic partial observability where the set of events the user can observe changes over time and is chosen by a dynamic mask. We show how to check that a system is opaque w.r.t. to a dynamic mask and also address the corresponding synthesis problem: given a system G and secret states S, compute the set of dynamic masks under which S is opaque. Our main result is that the set of such masks can be finitely represented and can be computed in EXPTIME and this is a lower bound. Finally we also address the problem of computing an optimal mask.

  Static source code analysis for software bug detection has come a long way since its early beginnings as a compiler technology. However, with the introduction of more sophisticated algorithmic techniques, such as model checking and constraint solving, questions about performance are a major concern. In this work we present an empirical study of our industrial strength source code analysis tool Goanna that uses a model checking core for static analysis of C/C++ code. We present the core technology and abstraction mechanism with a focus on performance, as guided by experience from having analyzed millions of lines of code. In particular, we present results from our recent study within the NIST/DHS SAMATE program. The results show that, maybe surprisingly, formal verification techniques can be used successfully in practical industry applications scaling roughly linearly, even for millions of lines of code.

In this paper, we focus on the synthesis of secure timed systems which are modelled as timed automata. The security property that the system must satisfy is a non-interference property. Intuitively, non-interference ensures the absence of any causal dependency from a high-level domain to a lower-level domain. Various notions of non-interference have been defined in the literature, and in this paper we focus on Strong Non-deterministic Non-Interference (SNNI) and two (bi)simulation based variants thereof (CSNNI and BSNNI). We consider timed non-interference properties for timed systems specified by timed automata and we study the two following problems: (1) check whether it is possible to find a sub-system so that it is non-interferent; if yes (2) compute a (largest) sub-system which is non-interferent.

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper we introduce a framework for computing upper bounds yet
accurate WCET for hardware platforms with caches and pipelines. The methodology
we propose consists of 3 steps: 1) given a program to analyse, compute an
equivalent (WCET-wise) abstract program; 2) build a timed game by composing
this abstract program with a network of timed automata modeling the
architecture; and 3) compute the WCET as the optimal time to reach a winning
state in this game. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework on
standard benchmarks for an ARM9 processor with instruction and data caches, and
compute the WCET with UPPAAL-TiGA. We also show that this framework can easily
be extended to take into account dynamic changes in the speed of the processor
during program execution.

  ABSTRACT = { Computing accurate WCET on modern complex architectures is a challenging task. This problem has been devoted a lot of attention in the last decade but there are still some open issues. First, the control flow graph (CFG) of a binary program is needed to compute the WCET and this CFG is built using some internal knowledge of the compiler that generated the binary code; moreover once constructed the CFG has to be manually annotated with loop bounds. Second, the algorithms to compute the WCET (combining Abstract Interpretation and Integer Linear Programming) are tailored for specific architectures: changing the architecture (e.g. replacing an ARM7 by an ARM9) requires the design of a new ad hoc algorithm. Third, the tightness of the computed results (obtained using the available tools) are not compared to actual execution times measured on the real hardware. In this paper we address the above mentioned problems. We first describe a fully automatic method to compute a CFG based solely on the binary program to analyse. Second, we describe the model of the hardware as a product of timed automata, and this model is independent from the program description. The model of a program running on a hardware is obtained by synchronizing (the automaton of) the program with the (timed automata) model of the hardware. Computing the WCET is reduced to a reachability problem on the synchronised model and solved using the model-checker UPPAAL. Finally, we present a rigorous methodology that enables us to compare our computed results to actual execution times measured on a real platform, the ARM920T.},

The systems model considered is one in which agents operate synchronously with awareness of the global clock. This enables timing based attacks to be captured, whereas previous work on this topic has dealt primarily with asynchronous systems. Versions of the notions of nondeducibility on inputs, nondeducibility on strategies, and an unwinding based notion are formulated for this model. All three notions are shown to be decidable, and their computational complexity is characterised.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we review some recent results about the use of dynamic observers for fault diagnosis of discrete event systems. Fault diagnosis consists in synthesizing a diagnoser that observes a given plant and identifies faults in the plant as soon as possible after their occurrence. Existing literature on this problem has considered the case of fixed static observers, where the set of observable events is fixed and does not change during execution of the system. In this paper, we consider dynamic observers: an observer can "switch" sensors on or off, thus dynamically changing the set of events it wishes to observe. It is known that checking diagnosability (i.e., whether a given observer is capable of identifying faults) can be solved in polynomial time for static observers, and we show that the same is true for dynamic ones. We also solve the problem of dynamic observers' synthesis and prove that a most permissive observer can be computed in doubly exponential time, using a game-theoretic approach. We further investigate optimization problems for dynamic observers and define a notion of cost of an observer.}

  ABSTRACT = {   In this paper, we address the problem of synthesizing \emph{opaque}
  systems by selecting the set of observable
  events.
  We first investigate the case of \emph{static}  observability
  where the set of observable events
  is fixed a priori.  In this context, we show that checking whether a
  system is opaque and computing an optimal static observer ensuring
  opacity are both PSPACE-complete problems.
  Next, we introduce \emph{dynamic} partial observability where the
  set of observable events
  can
  change over time.
  We show how to check that a system is opaque \wrt a dynamic observer
  and also address the corresponding synthesis problem: given a system
  $G$ and secret states $S$, compute the set of dynamic observers
  under which $S$ is opaque. Our main result is that the synthesis
  problem can be solved in EXPTIME.},

We show how to use three different classes of models and their supporting existing tools, UPPAAL-TIGA for synthesis, PHAVER for verification, and SIMULINK for simulation, in a complementary way. We believe that this case study shows that our tools have reached a level of maturity that allows us to tackle interesting and relevant industrial control problems.}

  ABSTRACT = {We study sensor minimization problems in the context of
                  fault diagnosis. Fault diagnosis consists in
                  synthesizing a diagnoser that observes a given plant
                  and identifies faults in the plant as soon as
                  possible after their occurrence. Existing literature
                  on this problem has considered the case of fixed
                  static observers, where the set of observable events
                  is fixed and does not change during execution of the
                  system. In this paper, we consider static observers
                  where the set of observable events is not fixed, but
                  needs to be optimized (e.g., minimized in size). We
                  also consider dynamic observers, where the observer
                  can ``switc'' sensors on or off, thus dynamically
                  changing the set of events it wishes to observe. It
                  is known that checking diagnosability (i.e., whether
                  a given observer is capable of identifying faults)
                  can be solved in polynomial time for static
                  observers, and we show that the same is true for
                  dynamic ones. On the other hand, minimizing the
                  number of (static) observable events required to
                  achieve diagnosability is NP-complete. We show that
                  this is true also in the case of mask-based
                  observation, where some events are observable but
                  not distinguishable. For dynamic observers'
                  synthesis, we prove that a most permissive
                  finite-state observer can be computed in doubly
                  exponential time, using a game-theoretic
                  approach. We further investigate optimization
                  problems for dynamic observers and define a notion of
                  cost of an observer. We show how to compute an
                  optimal observer using results on mean-payoff games

It is already known that the class of bounded TPNs is strictly included in the class of TA. It is thus natural to try and identify the subclass of TA equivalent to some TPN for the weak timed bisimulation relation. We give a characterization of this subclass and we show that the membership problem and the reachability problem  are PSPACE-complete. Furthermore we show that for a TA in this class with integer constants, an equivalent TPN can be built with integer bounds but with a size exponential w.r.t. the original model. Surprisingly, using rational bounds yields a TPN whose size is linear.}

  ABSTRACT = {In this chapter we introduce a formalism, \emph{Time
                  Petri Nets (TPNs)}, to model real-time systems. We
                  compare it with another well-known formalism,
                  \emph{Timed Automata (TA)}, used for specifying
                  timed systems.  We precisely define the semantics of
                  TPNs and TA and compare them according to two
                  criteria: the \emph{languages} (or set of
                  behaviours) then can generate, and the \emph{trees}
                  (or branching behaviours) they can generate.  We
                  show that every TPN can be translated into an
                  equivalent TA.  Then, we introduce a real-time logic
                  to specify properties of real-time systems. We show
                  how to check that a given TPN satisfies a property
                  written in this logic. For this we use our
                  translation\footnote{This translation preserves the
                  properties of this logic.} from TPNs to TA and check
                  the property on the equivalent TA. Finally we
                  briefly report on experiments for checking real-time
                  properties of TPNs using this framework. },

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we consider Time Petri Nets (TPN)
                  where time is associated with transitions. We give a
                  formal semantics for TPNs in terms of Timed
                  Transition Systems. Then, we propose a translation
                  from TPNs to Timed Automata (TA) that preserves the
                  behavioral semantics (timed bisimilarity) of the
                  TPNs. For the theory of TPNs this result is
                  two-fold: i) reachability problems and more
                  generally TCTL model-checking are decidable for
                  bounded TPNs; ii) allowing strict time constraints
                  on transitions for TPNs preserves the results
                  described in i). The practical appli- cations of the
                  translation are: i) one can specify a system using
                  both TPNs and Timed Automata and a precise semantics
                  is given to the composition; ii) one can use
                  existing tools for analyzing timed automata (like
                  Kronos, Uppaal or Cmc) to analyze TPNs. In this
                  paper we describe the new feature of the tool Romeo
                  that implements our translation of TPNs in the
                  Uppaal input format. We also report on experiments
                  carried out on various examples and compare the
                  result of our method to state-of-the-art tool for

We study the monitoring and fault-diagnosis problems for dense-time real-time systems, where observers (monitors and diagnosers) have access to digital rather than analog clocks. Analog clocks are infinitely-precise, thus, not implementable. We show how, given a specification mod- eled as a timed automaton and a timed automaton model of the digital clock, a sound and optimal (i.e., as precise as possible) digital-clock monitor can be synthesized. We also show how, given plant and digital clock modeled as timed automata, we can check existence of a digital-clock diagnoser and, if one exists, how to synthesize it. Finally, we consider the problem of existence of digital-clock diag- nosers where the digital clock is unknown. We show that there are cases where a digital clock, no matter how precise, does not exist, even though the system is diagnosable with analog clocks. Finally, we provide a sufficient condition for digital-clock diagnosability.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study the model of Time Petri Nets (TPNs) where a time interval is associated with the firing of a transition, but we extend it by considering general intervals rather than closed ones. A key feature of timed models is the memory policy, i.e. which timing informations are kept when a transition is fired. The original model selects an intermediate semantics where the transitions disabled after consuming the tokens, as well as the firing transition, are reinitialised. However this semantics is not appropriate for some applications. So we consider here two alternative semantics: the atomic and the persistent atomic ones. First we present relevant patterns of discrete event systems which show the interest of these semantics. Then we compare the expressiveness of the three semantics w.r.t. the weak time bisimilarity establishing inclusion results in the general case. Furthermore we show that some inclusions are strict with unrestricted intervals even when nets are bounded. Then we focus on bounded TPNs with upper-closed intervals and we prove that the semantics are equivalent. Finally taking into account both the practical and the theoretical issues, we conclude that persistent atomic semantics should be preferred.},

The algorithm we propose is a symbolic extension of the on-the-fly algorithm suggested by Liu &amp; Smolka [15] for linear-time model-checking of finite-state systems. Being on-the-fly, the symbolic algorithm may terminate long before having explored the entire state-space. Also the individual steps of the algorithm are carried out efficiently by the use of so-called zones as the underlying data structure.
Various optimizations of the basic symbolic algorithm are proposed as well as methods for obtaining time-optimal winning strategies (for reachability games). Extensive evaluation of an experimental implementation of the algorithm yields very encouraging performance results.},

Abstract. In this paper we use the timed modal logic Lnu to specify control objectives for timed plants. We show that the control problem for a large class of objectives can be reduced to a model-checking problem for an extension (Lcont) of the logic Lnu with a new modality.
More precisely we define a fragment of Lnu, namely Ldet, such that any
control objective of Lnudet can be translated into a Lcont formula that
holds for the plant if and only if there is a controller that can enforce
the control objective.
We also show that the new modality of Lcont strictly increases the expressive power of Lnu
while model-checking of Lcont remains EXPTIME-complete.},

We then propose a structural translation from TA to (1-safe) TPNs preserving timed language acceptance. Further on, we prove that the previous (slightly extended) translation also preserves weak timed bisimilarity for a syntactical subclass of TA. For the theory of TPNs, the consequences are: 1) TA, bounded TPNs and 1-safe TPNs are equally expressive w.r.t. timed language acceptance; 2) TA are strictly more expressive than bounded TPNs w.r.t. timed bisimilarity; 3) The subclass bounded and 1-safe TPNs “`a la Merlin” are equally expressive w.r.t. timed bisimilarity.},
