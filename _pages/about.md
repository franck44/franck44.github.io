I am a computer scientist with interest in **formal methods**,  more specifically automated verification techniques such as software verification and model-checking, static analysis. 
I have a strong expertise in **modelling and verification of concurrent (distributed) systems**.
I have contributed several important results in the theoretical foundations of verification of concurrent systems and also developed software analysis tools (static analysis, model-checking), Scala packages (SMT-solvers, finite automata), and recently Dafny-verified programs.

Experience
=========

I currently work at ConsenSys Software R&D as an Applied Researcher, and the main projects I am involved in are:

- **formal specification and verification of the Eth2.0 Phase 0 specification (Beacon chain)**. We use the verification-aware programming language **Dafny** to formally (i.e. rigorously and mathematically) [verify the  Eth2 specification](https://github.com/ConsenSys/eth2.0-dafny).

- **formal verification of the Deposit Smart Contract** algorithms. I have developed the [first fully mechanised correctness proof of the incremental Merkle tree algorithm in Dafny](https://github.com/ConsenSys/deposit-sc-dafny).

Before joining ConsenSys, I worked as a research scientist/academic for 25 years, at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS, France), National ICT Australia (NICTA now DATA61, Sydney AU) and Macquarie University (Sydney AU). 

Professional Memberships
======

I have been an [ACM](https://www.acm.org) member since 2008, and was an IEEE Member from 2009 to 2014.
I am a **Marie Curie Fellow**, was awarded a Marie Curie Fellowship (an individual EU research excellence competitive research grant) in 2008--2011. 

Publications
=====
I have published more than 80 research papers [(DBLP entries)](https://dblp.org/pid/99/622.html) in peer-reviewed journals & conferences, 1 US patent and several software packages.
I serve regularly on program committees of top-tier conferences.
