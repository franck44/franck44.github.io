About me
=========

I am a computer scientist with interest in **formal methods**,  more specifically automated verification techniques such as software verification and model-checking, static analysis. 
My background is **theoretical computer science** but I have also developed some software (static analysis tools), Scala packages (SMT-solvers, finite automata), Dafny verified programs.

Experience 
=====

I am currently work at ConsenSys Software R&D as an Applied Researcher, and the main projecta I am involved in are:

- **formal specification and verification of the Eth2.0 Phase 0 specification (Beacon chain)**. We use the verification-aware programming language **Dafny** to formally (i.e. rigorously and mathematically) verify the  Eth2 specification.

- **formal verification of the Deposit Smart Contract** algorithms.

Before joining ConsenSys, I worked as a research scientist/academic for 25 years, at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS, France), National ICT Australia (NICTA, Sydney AU) and Macquarie University (Sydney AU). 

Professional Memberships
======

I am a member of thr ACM since 2008, and was an IEEE Member from 2009 to 2014.
I am a **Marie Curie Fellow**, was awarded a Marie Curie Fellowship (an individual EU research excellence competitive research grant) in 2008--2011. 

Publications
=====
I have published more than 90 research papers in peer-reviewed journals & conferences, 1 US patent and several software packages.
I am serving regularly on program committees of top-tier conferences.
